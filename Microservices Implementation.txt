Microservices Implementation
----------------------------------------------------

Creation of Eureka Discovery Server
With Spring Boot, just one annotation @EnableEurekaServer does the job.


Creating Producer Microservice
Register itself with Discovery Service
@EnableDiscoveryClient activates the Netflix Eureka DiscoveryClient implementation


Create Consumer Microservice which finds the producer service instance registered with Discovery Service
Register itself with Discovery Service
@EnableDiscoveryClient activates the Netflix Eureka DiscoveryClient implementation
Requests for DiscoveryClient instance of Producer Microservice using a smart RestTemplate.


We can then test end-to-end result by starting the Eureka service first. Once the Eureka service starts up, start the discovery clients one after the other.
