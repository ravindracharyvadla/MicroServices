Microservice is a small, loosely coupled distributed service (Ex: 50,00,000 lines code)

Large application and decompose or break into easily manageable small components.

The main objective of the micro-services implementation is to split up the application as separate service for each core and API service functionality and it should be deployed independently on cloud. 

-Make code changes fast 
-Independent deployment
-Deployment time reduce
-Technology diversity i.e. we can mix libraries, databases, frameworks etc.
-Fault isolation i.e. a process failure should not bring the whole system down.
-Easier Process Adaption
-Each service can be independently DURS (deployed, updated, replaced, and scaled).
